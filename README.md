Anime refers to animation produced in Japan.. Anime has been rising in popularity in the last 10 years. Due to this trend, several platforms and websites have been created for fans to rate anime, with Anilist being one of them. The goal of this research is to group anime fans on anilist website. So we are able to know what genre of anime each group favors and to know how much the majority of anime fans rate on the quality of anime production. The research flow involves discovering the topic, understanding the problem, conducting a literature review, collecting data through scraping, and processing the data using clustering methods, specifically the HDBSCAN algorithm. Through these methods, three clusters were identified from a sample of 1871 anime fans, and the top two genres for each cluster were determined.
